# A workflow file that generates macOS Tahoe recovery image 

### Full installer downloaded straight from Apple and then recover image is extracted 

# Why you may need this ? 

Without the recovery image, you need to be on macOS to install Tahoe. Since there's no stable release yet, no official recovery images are available either.
This repo will fetch the full beta installer and zip what you need to have in order to install Tahoe from recovery. 

# How to use this ?

Fork this repo and run `Generate macOS Tahoe Recovery Image` worflow.

Once done you will have com.apple.recovery.boot.zip artifact 

Unzip it and you will have com.apple.recovery.boot
